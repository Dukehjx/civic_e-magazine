            <p>As a key direction for the AI industry, large models are a vital lever for Shanghai to cultivate new quality productive forces. Research shows that Shanghai's large model enterprises face bottlenecks such as <strong>high R&D costs, low financing, difficulty in obtaining high-quality data, slow commercialization, and limited industry communication.</strong></p>

            <h2>I. Primary Challenges</h2>

            <h3>1. High R&D Costs and Low Direct Financing for Large Model Enterprises</h3>
            <p>Large model enterprises' R&D costs mainly include hardware costs, energy consumption, and data acquisition expenses. According to enterprise leaders, high-performance computing equipment required for large model training accounts for the bulk of costs, currently only manageable through innovative algorithmic architectures and other strategies to improve training efficiency and reduce costs. Although Xuhui District has established four venture capital funds and provided cumulative computing power subsidies totaling 39.19 million yuan to enterprises, this remains insufficient compared to the overwhelming pressure of high R&D costs for large model enterprises.</p>

            <h3>2. Difficulty in Obtaining High-Quality Data Reduces Training Effectiveness</h3>
            <p>The success of a large model is 20% determined by algorithms and 80% by data quality. Through research at "Model Speed Space," many large model startup teams and enterprise leaders reported that limited channels for obtaining high-quality data and high costs are important bottleneck obstacles restricting large model training effectiveness. Although the municipal data company Midu Technology has been established and operational, providing relatively high-quality data mostly in vertical domains, the quantity is limited and prices are relatively expensive.</p>

            <h3>3. Slow Technology Commercialization Process with Few Application Scenarios</h3>
            <p>Currently, Shanghai's municipal and district governments have begun actively building supply-demand matching platforms, supporting enterprises in exploring breakthroughs in application implementation through special fund subsidies and government procurement services. However, truly implemented and commercially operational large model application scenarios in Shanghai remain very scarce. Some large model enterprise leaders reported that many large model companies focus on R&D, and due to the shortage of compound talents who understand both large model technology and applications, enterprises often lack clarity about potential user needs.</p>

            <h3>4. Limited Industry Communication with Incomplete Innovation Incubation Service System</h3>
            <p>First, talent shortages constrain intra-industry exchange and cooperation. Although Shanghai has gathered nearly 250,000 AI talents, Shanghai's AI talent supply-demand ratio remains below 1. Second, insufficient industry exchange platforms. Currently, apart from the annual World Artificial Intelligence Conference as a global industry exchange platform, Shanghai lacks daily, high-frequency, flexible AI industry exchange platforms.</p>

            <h2>II. Policy Recommendations</h2>

            <h3>1. Build Full-Chain Equity Investment System and Public Technical Service Platform</h3>
            <p>First, continue leveraging the guiding role of government investment funds, establishing and introducing new industrial funds around the AI large model field. Second, build a public technical service platform. It is recommended that Shanghai Computing Operations lead, based on the common hardware technical equipment needs of large model enterprises, to build a public technical service platform serving large model enterprises.</p>

            <h3>2. Strengthen Data Circulation and Cross-Regional Cooperation to Break Data Supply Bottlenecks</h3>
            <p>First, enhance data circulation capabilities. Jointly establish data opening platforms with key central enterprises, municipal state-owned enterprises, data service enterprises, and research institutions to promote the aggregation, access, sharing, processing, and use of high-quality and highly available data. Second, leverage Yangtze River Delta integration advantages and strengthen regional cooperation to solve data and computing power challenges.</p>

            <h3>3. Conduct Large Model Tech and Scenario Innovation to Create Landmark Application Scenarios</h3>
            <p>First, establish Shanghai AIGC Major Science and Technology Special Project. Second, based on "small entry points, deep applications," create a batch of landmark application scenarios. Focus on three major fields—manufacturing, social welfare, and cultural technology and social governance—to conduct large model application scenario innovation.</p>

            <h3>4. Create Multi-Level Exchange Platforms to Form "Multi-Park Clustering" Industrial Pattern</h3>
            <p>First, make good use of existing exchange platform resources. Continue to leverage existing international and national-level platforms such as the World Artificial Intelligence Conference, Global Developer Pioneer Conference, and China Embodied Intelligence Conference. Second, create normalized exchange platforms. Third, deepen industrial cooperation with "one horizontal, one vertical" strategy.</p>

            <p>大模型作为人工智能产业和技术的重要发展方向，是上海培养新质生产力的重要抓手。课题组调研发现，当前上海大模型企业发展面临<strong>自主研发成本高和融资量级低、高质量语料获取难、技术商业化进程慢、行业沟通交流少</strong>等瓶颈问题。</p>

            <h2>一、主要问题</h2>

            <h3>1、大模型企业自主研发成本高，获取直接融资量级低</h3>
            <p>大模型企业的研发成本主要包括硬件成本、‌能源消耗以及语料购置费用等。相关企业负责人反映，大模型训练所需的高性能计算设备占据成本大头，目前只能靠创新算法架构等策略提升训练效率和降低训练成本。尽管徐汇区成立了4支创投基金，并已累计向企业提供3919万元算力补贴等资金支持，但仍是杯水车薪，无法达到缓解大模型企业研发成本高企压力。</p>

            <h3>2、大模型企业高质量语料获取难，降低大模型训练实效</h3>
            <p>大模型成功与否，20%由算法决定，80%由数据质量决定。课题组通过调研"模速空间"，众多大模型创业团队和企业负责人反映，高质量语料获取渠道受限、成本高昂是制约大模型训练实效的重要瓶颈障碍。虽然市语料公司蜜度科技已经落地运行，且其提供的语料质量较高，且大多为垂直领域数据，但是其数量偏少且价格偏贵。</p>

            <h3>3、大模型领域技术商业化进程慢，落地应用场景稀少</h3>
            <p>当前上海市区两级政府已经开始积极搭建供需对接平台，通过专项资金补贴和政府购买服务形式，支持企业在应用落地上探索突破。但是，上海目前真正落地并实现商业化运行的大模型应用场景仍然十分稀少。部分大模型企业负责人反映，大模型企业很多侧重于研发，由于大模型企业内通晓大模型技术与应用的复合型人才匮乏，企业往往对可能催生的用户需求不明确。</p>

            <h3>4、大模型行业沟通交流少，双创孵化服务体系待完善</h3>
            <p>一是人才短缺制约行业内交流合作。尽管上海已经集聚近25万人工智能人才，但上海人工智能人才供需比仍然低于1。二是行业交流平台不足。目前，上海除一年一度的世界人工智能大会这一全球性行业交流平台之外，还缺少日常性、高频率、小快灵特征的人工智能行业交流平台。</p>

            <h2>二、政策建议</h2>

            <h3>1、打造全链条股权投资体系，搭建公共技术服务平台</h3>
            <p>一是持续发挥政府投资基金引导作用，围绕人工智能大模型领域新设和引入产业基金。二是搭建公共技术服务平台。建议由上海算力运营主体仪电智算牵头，基于大模型企业共性硬件技术设备需求，搭建服务于大模型企业的公共技术服务平台。</p>

            <h3>2、强化数据流通与跨区域合作，破解语料供给瓶颈</h3>
            <p>一是提升数据流通能力。联合重点央企、市属国企、数商企业、科研院所等搭建数据开放平台，推动高质量与高可用数据的汇集、访问、共享、处理和使用。二是发挥长三角一体化优势，强化区域协作破解语料和算力难题。</p>

            <h3>3、开展大模型科技与场景创新，打造标志性应用场景</h3>
            <p>一是设立上海AIGC重大科技专项。二是基于"小切口、深应用"打造一批标志性应用场景。重点面向制造业、社会民生、文化科技与社会治理三大领域开展大模型应用场景创新。</p>

            <h3>4、打造多层次交流平台，形成"多园集聚"产业业态</h3>
            <p>一是用好现有交流平台资源。继续用好世界人工智能大会、全球开发者先锋大会、中国具身智能大会等现有国际级、国家级平台。二是打造常态化交流平台。三是以"一横一纵"战略深化产业合作。</p>
