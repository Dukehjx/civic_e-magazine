        As China’s “dual carbon” strategy accelerates, traditional energy sources are gradually exiting while new energy sources scale up—one moving out, the other moving in. Achieving the dual carbon goals requires that the phase-out of traditional energy be firmly grounded in the safe and reliable substitution of renewables. Yet large-scale deployment of renewable energy still faces challenges of intermittency, volatility, and instability.
      </p>

      <p>
        New-type energy storage offers a way forward. By smoothing fluctuations and supporting the large-scale grid integration of solar and wind power, it is widely regarded as a core technology and foundational equipment of the new power system, as well as a critical pillar for achieving the dual carbon targets. At the same time, new-type energy storage is a strategic frontier for fostering new domestic energy business models and securing a competitive edge internationally.
      </p>

      <p>
        Amid this surge of momentum, local industrial layouts are shifting rapidly. Green, low-carbon sectors—represented by energy storage technologies and measured in the trillions of yuan—are opening up as new growth tracks. Shanghai and Yunnan are well positioned to work together in advancing the new-type energy storage industry. With the aim of building a future innovation highland and scaling up a competitive industrial cluster, a research team from the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences conducted field studies to identify key bottlenecks in both regions and propose policy measures to further promote two-way empowerment between Shanghai and Yunnan.
      </p>

      <h2>I. Bottlenecks in Shanghai’s New-Type Energy Storage Industry</h2>

      <h3>1. High costs of green electricity</h3>
      <p>
        Shanghai lacks local green energy resources. It has no hydropower or pumped-storage facilities, limited nuclear power resources, and only modest room for expanding photovoltaic generation due to land constraints. As a city with relatively scarce renewable energy reserves, Shanghai still relies heavily on importing electricity from other regions to reduce carbon emissions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although new-type energy storage is itself a low-carbon industry, the production process—whether battery manufacturing and assembly or the production of key materials such as cathodes and anodes—is highly energy-intensive. Green electricity therefore becomes an “invisible but critical” input. Scarcity of green power has emerged as a key constraint.
      </p>

      <p>
        By contrast, nearly 90% of Yunnan’s power mix comes from hydropower, wind, and solar. The province leads nationally in electricity market-based trading, and its average industrial electricity prices are consistently below the national average.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Limited endowment of upstream raw materials</h3>
      <p>
        Upstream segments of the energy storage value chain rely on metals such as lithium, nickel, aluminum, and steel, as well as key battery materials including cathodes, anodes, separators, and electrolytes. Cathode materials are the most decisive factor for battery performance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Shanghai is poorly endowed with nearly all of these resources. Yunnan, in contrast, holds abundant reserves of phosphorus, lithium, manganese, copper, nickel, aluminum, and graphite, with several ranking among the top three nationwide.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Limited scale of demonstration projects</h3>
      <p>
        Shanghai has launched pilot hydrogen and energy storage projects in renewable integration, grid peak shaving, and green data centers. However, demonstration scales remain small and application scopes narrow.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yunnan offers a broader range of application scenarios, making it well suited for scaling demonstrations, expanding use cases, and reducing costs.
      </p>

      <h2>II. Bottlenecks in Yunnan’s New-Type Energy Storage Industry</h2>

      <h3>1. Industry chain still in cultivation</h3>
      <p>
        Yunnan’s storage industry is concentrated in Dali and Chuxiong, with several projects already operational. However, the overall industry chain remains in its early stages, lacking leading firms and diversified technology pathways.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Exposure to technology substitution risks</h3>
      <p>
        Long-term trends point to risks from solid-state lithium batteries and sodium-ion batteries. These could displace current material routes, posing structural risks to Yunnan’s lithium materials sector.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Shortages of core technologies and specialized talent</h3>
      <p>
        While Yunnan leads in lithium-ion separator capacity, it lacks proprietary technologies in cathodes, anodes, and electrolytes. Specialized interdisciplinary talent is also in short supply.
      </p>

      <h2>III. Policy Recommendations</h2>

      <h3>1. “Shanghai R&amp;D + Yunnan Manufacturing”</h3>
      <p>
        Establish dedicated R&amp;D bases in Shanghai and promote joint research, shared facilities, and industry alliances to integrate the value chain.
      </p>

      <h3>2. “Shanghai Market + Yunnan Resources”</h3>
      <p>
        Deepen strategic cooperation, expand green power trading, and develop integrated wind–solar–storage zero-carbon industrial parks.
      </p>

      <h3>3. “Shanghai Technology + Yunnan Scenarios”</h3>
      <p>
        Scale hydrogen and sodium-ion storage applications in Yunnan while expanding Shanghai’s technology deployment and mitigating substitution risks.

        随着“双碳”战略加速推进，传统能源逐步退出，新型能源加快进入。实现“双碳”目标，必须建立在新能源安全可靠替代的基础之上，但新能源大规模利用仍面临间歇性、波动性和不稳定性挑战。
      </p>

      <p>
        新型储能可以有效平抑波动，支撑光伏、风电大规模并网，是新型电力系统的重要技术和基础装备，也是实现“双碳”目标的重要支撑。
      </p>

      <p>
        在这一背景下，以储能为代表的万亿级绿色低碳新赛道加速展开。沪滇两地在新型储能产业协同发展方面潜力巨大。上海社会科学院课题组通过调研，系统梳理两地发展瓶颈，并提出双向赋能对策建议。
      </p>

      <h2>一、上海新型储能产业发展的瓶颈</h2>

      <h3>1. 绿电成本高</h3>
      <p>
        上海本地新能源资源匮乏，仍需大量外来电力支撑降碳目标，而储能产业本身又是高耗能产业，绿电成为关键约束。
      </p>

      <p>
        相比之下，云南水电、风电、光电占比近90%，工业电价显著低于全国平均水平。
      </p>

      <h3>2. 上游原材料资源匮乏</h3>
      <p>
        储能产业上游关键金属和材料在上海分布极少，而云南拥有丰富的锂、镍、锰、磷、石墨等资源储量。
      </p>

      <h3>3. 示范规模偏小</h3>
      <p>
        上海储能应用仍以小规模试点为主，应用场景和用量有限。
      </p>

      <h2>二、云南新型储能产业发展的瓶颈</h2>

      <h3>1. 产业链仍处培育阶段</h3>
      <p>
        云南储能产业已初具规模，但整体仍缺乏龙头企业，技术路线相对单一。
      </p>

      <h3>2. 技术替代风险</h3>
      <p>
        固态电池、钠离子电池等新技术路径可能对现有锂电材料产业形成冲击。
      </p>

      <h3>3. 核心技术与人才短缺</h3>
      <p>
        在正极、负极、电解液等关键环节仍缺乏自主核心技术，专业储能人才供给不足。
      </p>

      <h2>三、沪滇新型储能双向赋能的对策建议</h2>

      <h3>1. “上海研发 + 云南制造”</h3>
      <p>
        共建研发基地和产业联盟，推动全产业链协同发展。
      </p>

      <h3>2. “上海市场 + 云南资源”</h3>
      <p>
        推进绿电跨省交易，建设风光储一体化零碳产业园。
      </p>

      <h3>3. “上海技术 + 云南场景”</h3>
      <p>
        通过场景落地扩大技术示范规模，实现双向赋能、协同发展。
