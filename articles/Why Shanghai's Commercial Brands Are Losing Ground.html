            <blockquote>
                Shanghai has long been regarded as the cradle of modern Chinese brands. From the late nineteenth century onward, the city nurtured a wide range of commercial brands that gained national recognition and, in some cases, international reach. Following the founding of the People's Republic of China, Shanghai continued to generate new commercial brands. However, during the transition from a planned economy to a market-oriented system, the position of Shanghai's traditional commercial brands gradually weakened. This decline can be attributed to four main factors.
            </blockquote>

            <h2>I. The Vitality of Light Manufacturing Brands Has Diminished</h2>
            <p>With the deepening of market reforms and economic opening, many Shanghai-based light manufacturing brands continued to rely on traditional management practices, production models, and technologies. Their response to changing consumer demand was often slow, while investment in product research and development remained insufficient or inefficiently translated into commercial outcomes. As a result, product quality and value-added content struggled to keep pace with market expectations.</p>
            <p>At the same time, rising costs of land, labor, and other production factors eroded price competitiveness. To reduce costs, some enterprises relocated manufacturing facilities to other parts of the Yangtze River Delta, shrinking Shanghai's local production base. Although this spatial expansion of the supply chain reduced immediate cost pressures, it also introduced new challenges related to logistics, coordination, and operational efficiency.</p>

            <h2>II. Pressure from International and Domestic Competitors</h2>
            <p>Global brands, backed by strong capital, advanced technology, global supply chains, and sophisticated branding strategies, have captured significant market share in Shanghai. Fast-fashion brands such as Zara and H&M, for example, have established stable positions through rapid product turnover and globalized operations, often outperforming local brands in design, marketing, and brand communication.</p>
            <p>At the same time, emerging domestic brands have risen quickly by leveraging cost advantages, innovation, and flexible business models. Brands from cities such as Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Hangzhou have developed strong competitive edges in electronics, internet services, and apparel, drawing market share away from Shanghai brands through aggressive marketing, novel commercial models, technological innovation, and lower operating costs.</p>

            <h2>III. The Rapid Expansion of the Internet Economy</h2>
            <p>According to data from MobTech in 2021, a clear mismatch exists between the composition of retail formats in Shanghai's major commercial districts and consumer preferences. Traditional retail still accounts for more than 50 percent of stores in most shopping areas, exceeding 70 percent in Xujiahui, yet consumer demand for such formats is only around 35 percent.</p>
            <p>In contrast, e-commerce has expanded rapidly. In 2023, Shanghai recorded RMB 3.7 trillion in total e-commerce transactions, an annual increase of 11.7 percent, with online retail alone reaching RMB 1.6 trillion, up 22.2 percent year-on-year. Livestream-based retail sales reached RMB 253.2 billion, nearly five times the combined revenue of Shanghai's 23 major offline shopping malls.</p>
            <p>Leading livestream influencers, such as Li Jiaqi, generated sales exceeding RMB 100 billion during the 2023 Singles' Day promotion and RMB 650 billion throughout the year, surpassing the total sales of Shanghai's major malls. A small number of top influencers, supported by massive follower bases and powerful marketing capabilities, have placed significant pressure on small and medium-sized brands while draining foot traffic from offline commercial districts.</p>

            <h2>IV. Weakened Innovation Capacity of Time-Honored Brands</h2>
            <p>Shanghai's time-honored brands are symbols of the city's commercial heritage. Currently, 197 Shanghai brands are recognized at the national level, accounting for 13.54 percent of all nationally certified time-honored brands, while 104 are recognized at the municipal level. However, since the early 2000s, many of these brands have shown clear signs of stagnation, with some exiting the market altogether.</p>
            <p>Key reasons include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Limited exploration of brand value and delayed efforts in youth-oriented and differentiated transformation, resulting in a disconnect between historical legacy and contemporary consumer needs</li>
                <li>Product innovation lagging behind structural changes in demand, while traditional product categories remain dominant</li>
                <li>Channel expansion inefficient, with weak integration between online and offline platforms and limited penetration into emerging consumption scenarios</li>
                <li>Supply chain coordination fragmented, and progress toward internationalization slow, hindered by weak localization strategies, insufficient cultural integration, and inadequate intellectual property management</li>
                <li>Institutional rigidities, breaks in skill transmission, and a lack of innovation making it increasingly difficult to attract younger generations to traditional crafts, further exacerbated by workforce aging</li>
            </ul>

                上海作为近代中国品牌的摇篮，曾孕育出大批享誉全国乃至海外的商业品牌。自新中国成立后，上海又涌现了一批新兴商业品牌，但在计划经济向市场经济转型过程中，上海传统商业品牌地位逐渐下滑，主要原因有四个方面。
            </blockquote>

            <h2>一、轻纺工业品牌活力下降</h2>
            <p>随着市场经济的发展和改革开放的深入，<strong>上海轻纺工业品牌，一方面，</strong>长期依赖传统的经营管理方式、生产模式和技术，对市场需求的变化反应不够灵敏，新产品研发投入不足或技术转化效率低，导致产品质量和附加值难以满足市场需求。<strong>另一方面，</strong>土地、劳动力等生产要素成本不断上涨，在市场竞争中失去价格优势。一些轻纺工业企业为降低成本，不得不将生产基地转移至长三角等其他地区，导致上海本地轻纺工业生产规模缩小。产业链的空间维度扩大却又带来物流、协同等诸多问题。</p>

            <h2>二、国际国内品牌双向挤压</h2>
            <p>国际知名品牌凭借强大的技术、资本、品牌影响力、先进的管理经验和优质的产品抢占上海市场，例如，ZARA、H&M 等国际品牌依靠快速时尚模式和全球化供应链，在上海市场稳占一定份额；这些品牌在产品设计、市场营销、品牌推广等方面，比上海商业品牌具有明显优势。国内新兴品牌依托成本、创新等优势快速崛起，也纷纷涌入上海。国内其他城市商业品牌的快速崛起，又分流上海商业品牌一部分市场份额，例如，近年来，广州、深圳、杭州等城市在电子产品、互联网服务、服装等领域的商业品牌已形成自己优势，并凭借优秀营销推广策略、新颖的商业模式、高新技术产品和较低成本，对上海商业品牌建设构成有力冲击。</p>

            <h2>三、互联网经济激烈冲击</h2>
            <p>数据智能科技平台 MobTech 提供的 2021 年数据显示，上海主要商圈业态构成与商圈到访人群业态偏好之间存在较大差异。从店铺数量占比看，传统零售业态仍是各大商圈的主角，占比超过 50%，在徐家汇商圈甚至超过 70%，但客群对零售业态的需求仅为约 35%。2023 年上海全市实现电子商务交易额 3.7 万亿元，同比增长 11.7%，其中实现网络购物交易额 1.6 万亿元，同比增长 22.2%。上海直播零售额已经达到2532 亿元，是上海 23 家大型线下实体商业的近 5 倍，数据的巨大差异显示出网络电商对线下消费的巨大冲击。</p>
            <p>李佳琦2023 年双 11 带货达百亿元，2023 年总带货额达 650 亿元，超过上海 23 家商场的 550 亿元。<strong>少数头部主播</strong>凭借其巨大的粉丝基础和强大的营销能力，对中小品牌形成压榨，对<strong>线下商圈消费</strong>造成抽血。</p>

            <h2>四、老字号创新力弱化显著</h2>
            <p>上海老字号是城市商业文明的象征。目前，商务部认定的上海市中华老字号 197 家，占全国 13.54%。上海市商务委认定的上海老字号 104 家。自跨入新世纪以来，大部分上海老字号品牌疲态尽显，甚至退出市场，主要原因：</p>
            <ul>
                <li>一是品牌价值挖掘不足，年轻化与差异化转型滞后，历史底蕴与现代需求割裂，与消费者缺乏互动</li>
                <li>二是产品创新与结构失衡，传统品类依赖与新兴需求脱节，创新动力不足</li>
                <li>三是渠道拓展效率低下，线上线下融合与新兴场景渗透不足</li>
                <li>四是供应链协同效率低，跨区域与全链条整合能力不足</li>
                <li>五是国际化进程缓慢，本土化运营与文化融合能力薄弱，知识产权管理不善</li>
                <li>六是体制束缚、传承断裂、创新不足等，传统技艺传承难以招到愿意学习的年轻人，职工老化等</li>
            </ul>
